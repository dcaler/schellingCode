        # or the API was different.
        # However, standard Mesa DataCollector signature is:
        # DataCollector(model_vars=None, agent_vars=None, agent_reporters=None)
        # If 'model_vars' is unexpected, it might be that the version installed

        # Let's look at the error again: TypeError: DataCollector.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model_vars'
        # This is strange because 'model_vars' is the standard argument in Mesa 2.x+.
        # Perhaps the installed Mesa is 1.x? In Mesa 1.x, DataCollector didn't exist in the same way.
        # Or perhaps the argument name is different?
        # Let's try using positional arguments or checking the actual signature.
        # Actually, let's just try the standard 'model_vars' first. If it fails,
        # maybe the issue is something else.
        # Wait, the error is explicit.
